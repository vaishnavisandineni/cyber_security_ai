## Introduction
The financial sector, managing highly sensitive data and valuable assets, is a prime target for cybercriminals. Traditional signature-based and rule-based systems are increasingly insufficient to detect sophisticated attacks such as **APTs, phishing, and zero-day exploits**.  

**Machine Learning (ML)** allows for predictive threat detection by learning patterns from large datasets, providing proactive cybersecurity in financial institutions.

### Objective
- Review existing AI/ML applications in financial cybersecurity.
- Identify limitations of current systems.
- Propose a novel ML-based threat detection system.
- Provide design, implementation, and testing details.
- Discuss deployment requirements and expected outcomes.
